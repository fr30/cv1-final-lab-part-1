    "### **General Guidelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code must be handed in this Jupyter notebook, renamed to **StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.ipynb** before the deadline by submitting it to the Canvas Final Lab (Part 1) Assignment. Please also fill out your names and IDs above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For full credit, make sure your notebook follows these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please express your thoughts **concisely**. The number of words does not necessarily correlate with how well you understand the concepts.\n",
    "- Understand the problem as much as you can. When answering a question, provide evidence (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, figures, etc.) to support your arguments. Not everything might be explicitly asked for, so think about what might strengthen your arguments to make the notebook self-contained and complete.\n",
    "- Tables and figures must be accompanied by a **brief** description. Add a number, a title, and, if applicable, the name and unit of variables in a table, and name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions are not allowed.** Assignments submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs’ system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance to avoid last-minute system failure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment:** Since this is a project-based assignment, you are free to use any feature descriptor and machine learning tools (e.g., K-means, SVM). You should use Python for your implementation. You are free to use any Python library for this assignment, but make sure to provide a conda environment file!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plagiarism Note:** Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious offense and any misconduct will be addressed according to university regulations. This includes using generative tools such as ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensure that you save all results/answers to the questions (even if you reuse some code).**"

    "### **Report Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Report Preparation:** For both parts of the final project, students are expected to prepare a report. The report should include all details on implementation approaches, analysis of results for different settings, and visualizations illustrating experiments and performance of your implementation. Grading will be based on the report, so it should be as self-contained as possible. If the report contains faulty results or ambiguities, TAs can refer to your code for clarification. Only section 10 of this notebook should **not** be included in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explanation of Results:** Do not just provide numbers without explanation. Discuss different settings to show your understanding of the material and processes involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantitative Evaluation:** For quantitative evaluation, you are expected to provide the results based on the mAP (mean Average Precision) metric. You should report the mAP for each experimental setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Qualitative Evaluation:** For qualitative evaluation, you are expected to visualize the top-5 and bottom-5 ranked test images (based on classifier confidence for the target class) per setup. Provide a figure for each experimental setup Visual elements such as charts, graphs, and plots are always useful. Keep this in mind while writing your reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Aim:** Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline using a traditional Bag of Visual Words method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Working on Assignments:** Students should work in assigned groups for **two** weeks. Any questions can be discussed on ED.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Submission:** Submit your source code and report together in a zip file (`ID1_ID2_ID3_part1.zip`). The report should be a maximum of 10 pages (single-column, including tables and figures, excluding references and appendix). Express thoughts concisely. Tables and figures must be accompanied by a description. Number them and, if applicable, name variables in tables, and label axes in figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Hyperparameter Search:** In your experiments, remember to perform a hyperparameter search to find the optimal settings for your classifier. Clearly document the search process, the parameters you explored, and how they influenced the performance of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Format and Testing:** The report should be in **PDF format**, and the code in **.ipynb format**. Test that all functionality works as expected in the notebook."

You will experiment with various parameters, including the number of visual words (e.g., 500, 1000, 1500), different training subset sizes (e.g., 30%, 40%, 50%), SVM parameters (e.g., kernel types like 'linear' or 'rbf', regularization parameter $C$ values such as 0.1, 1, 10, and gamma settings like 'scale' or specific values such as 0.01, 0.001), and settings of the feature extractors (e.g., the number of keypoints or scale levels). Start by testing your code on the smallest subset to ensure it functions correctly before proceeding with a full hyperparameter search. Once validated, conduct the search using larger subsets and systematically iterate through the different parameter combinations, potentially using nested loops or grid search. Be sure to record the performance results for each combination to identify the best settings based on metrics like the Mean Average Precision (mAP)."

    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:red\">⚠️ NOTE: This section should NOT be included in the report. It is only meant to be completed in the code cells. The purpose of this task is to introduce you to a more state-of-the-art model (CLIP) compared to Bag of Visual Words (BoVW). Vision Transformers (ViT) will be covered in more detail in the Deep Learning 1 course next period!</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will use a pre-trained CLIP model for image classification. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is a vision-language transformer model trained on a large dataset of images and text. It consists of two main components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a text Transformer. The ViT encodes images by dividing them into patches (tokens), flattening each patch into a vector, and passing them through a sequence of Transformer layers to produce an encoded representation of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you will use the visual transformer component of CLIP to extract encoded representations of the input images. While this is not the typical way to use CLIP (which involves encoding both images and text for similarity comparison), it provides an interesting application of this state-of-the-art model for image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Install CLIP:**\n",
